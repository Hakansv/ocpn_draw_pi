# ocpn_draw_pi
OpenCPN general drawing plug in

Requires latest OCPN beta as it is using version 1.13 of the plugin API

Files are stored in share/opencpn/OCPNDraw/data & share/opencpn/OCPNDraw/images. You will need to copy the images from 
the /images folder to the share/opencpn/OCPNDraw/images folder.

Currently you will need to create the images folder before trying to run OCPNDraw. This should be fixed by the time 
there is an install process
